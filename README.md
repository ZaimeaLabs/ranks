## Introduction

Ranks is a lightweight yet powerful package that allows you to generate rankings directly from your Eloquent models and queries.

This package is ideal for:

✅ Leaderboards and scoring systems
✅ Gamification features
✅ Ranking users, teams, or items
✅ Aggregated statistics over time
✅ Any application that requires fast, database-driven ranking logic
